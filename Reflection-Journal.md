Here I am going to rate my peers accordingy to their over all perfromance in a week. First of all I will discuss little about Karan then Aradhana and so on.

Karan Sharma 

He is good at work, he knows how to intilaize the work in a group, moreover if I talk about his collaboration and role in the given task then it is ture to say that he can work in a group without any hassle. Futhermore, he is managing his responsibility very well. 

From my prespective I wants to give 4 rating out of 5.

Aradhna 

She is very proactive during the session. She handles work accordingly. In addition she takes part in every group activity that shows her capability in collaboration with other team members in a group.

From my point of view I will give her 4 rating out of 5.

Muskaben

She also takes part in group discussion that shows her ability to work in a team. Also, she asks questions if she stucks somewhere during the tasks. 

So, I will give her 4 rating out of 5.

If I talk about myself then I always tried to catch all the topics taught my Mr. Sami in a session. Moreover, I ask many questions as I can because this is one of the best way to solve my queries via questioning to tutor. I am giving my best to learn things. I give 5 rating for me.

# Challenges Faced #

During the week 01 I faced the major challenge of understanding the basic funtamentals for the course (such as coding). Also, it will take time to complete all the videos provided by Mr. Sami. But it is pretty sure that with time I will learn all the baiscs along with advance level.

# What Went Well and Lessons Learned: #

One of the best thing that I learned from last week is that how to work in a team. This way helps me out to share my douts with my peers and get the best solutions for them. Moreover, if I talk about the activities then it is the major task that went very good. I learned the process of executing the code in real time schenerios. 

Key Learning: 

From 1st week I leraned new fundamentals like Node js, javascript, Git and Git Hub. I get to know the right approach for programming that will surely help me out to become a Full Stack Develpoer. Furthermore, the very fist week will give right direction to my career. 

Online Resources:

Here I got to know how to handle the project in agile methodology. This method generates the power of managing things in a real time. From this I learned the process of submitting the tasks or activities during the session. 

# Final Thoughts: #

In my opinion, working in a group is one of the right thing beacuse in this way we get to know how work in a team that reduces our shyness and bulid the quality of expressing thoughts in front of others. From last week's experiences I would like to say that  I'm happy with my efforts in the course. Difficulties came in a path provided an opportunity to learn and grow in a life.

At the end I would like to thank Mr. Sami who explained things in a well ordered manner.
